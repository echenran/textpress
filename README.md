# Textpress
Ever wanted to send a friend a link, but had to go through finding the link, copying, returning to your messaging app, pasting, and finally sending? Textpress is an express texting service that allows users to bypass all of that and send a link directly to a recipient. It's a combination of DDG's !bang and Google's I'm Feeling Lucky search. 

### Services
Textpress currently supports Twitter, YouTube, and New York Times links. The keywords for each service:
Twitter: twitter
YouTube: youtube
New York Times: nytimes

### How to Use
Send an SMS in the following format to +16463744020:
"6460005555 twitter berniesanders" where the first word is a 10-digit phone number, the second is a service keyword, and the third is the search query (for Twitter, it has to be a user's handle). Currently, the recipient (the 10-digit phone number) has to be on our list of authenticated numbers, so unless your number is on there, Textpress will not work for you.
